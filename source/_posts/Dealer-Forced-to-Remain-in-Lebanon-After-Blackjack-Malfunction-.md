#  Dealer Forced to Remain in Lebanon After Blackjack Malfunction 

After a blackjack game malfunctioned, leaving dealer John unable to complete the game, he was forced to remain in Lebanon until the casino could fix the machine.

"I couldn't believe it when the machine malfunctioned," said John. "I was left with no choice but to stay in Lebanon until they could get it fixed."

John was stranded in Lebanon for two days while the casino worked to repair the machine. "It was really frustrating," he said. "I just wanted to go home."

Finally, after two long days, the machine was repaired and John was able to return home. "I was so relieved," he said. "That was a trip I never want to make again."

#  Dealer Remains in Lebanon to Settle Blackjack Debts 

Lebanon, NH - One of the dealers from the local blackjack table has refused to leave the small town until he has paid off all his debts. The remaining players are getting antsy, as the dealer has been at the table for hours on end and shows no sign of quitting.

"I've never seen anything like it," said one of the players. "He's been at it for hours, and he's still got a mountain of chips left."

According to witnesses, the dealer arrived at the casino early in the morning with a small fortune in chips. He proceeded to lose hand after hand, until he was down to his last few chips. At that point, he apparently decided to stay at the table and try to win back his losses.

"He's been gambling pretty recklessly," said one player. "I'm not sure how much longer we can keep this up."

The other players have begun to make noise, demanding that the dealer leave so they can finish their game. However, he shows no sign of relenting and continues to play blackjack like there's no tomorrow.

"It's kind of uncomfortable having him here," said one player. "I don't know what he's going to do if he loses everything."

So far, the dealer has lost over $2,000 worth of chips, but shows no signs of giving up. He remains at the table while the other players watch and wait for him to leave.

#  Casino Dealer Stuck in Lebanon After Blackjack Mishap 

A casino dealer in Lebanon is reportedly stuck in the country after an incident during a blackjack game led to him being accused of cheating.

The dealer, who has not been identified, is said to have incorrectly revealed the value of his cards during the game, leading to players accusing him of cheating.

It is not clear how long the dealer will be stuck in Lebanon for, or whether he will be able to return home eventually.

#  Dealer Forced to Stay in Beirut Casino to straighten out Blackjack Mess 

In the heart of Beirut's Casino du Liban, dealer Fouad Hadad is stuck at his table, forced to stay and fix a blackjack mess he created.

At around 1am on Tuesday morning, Hadad noticed that one of the players at his table was consistently busting with hands of 17 or 18. Figuring there must be an easy way to take advantage of the player, Hadad kept giving the player cards until they had 21. 

The scheme went undetected for a few hands, but eventually another dealer at the casino noticed what was happening and reported it to management. Hadad was called in for a meeting and was informed that he would be forced to stay at his table until the end of his shift on Wednesday in order to straighten out the mess he created.

A spokesperson for the casino said "We are very sorry for what happened, but we want to assure our customers that we are doing everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen again."

It's unclear how much money Hadad managed to win with his scheme, or if any other dealers were involved. But one thing is for sure - he won't be able to leave his table anytime soon.

#  Lebanese Casino Dealer Will Have to Stay Until Blackjack Debts are Paid

According to local news sources, a Lebanese casino dealer is being ordered to stay at the casino and work until his blackjack debts are paid in full. The dealer reportedly owes the casino $38,000, and the casino has decided that he will not be allowed to leave until the debt is repaid.

This isn't the first time that a debt-related issue has arisen at this particular casino. In fact, last year two other dealers were ordered to stay at the casino until their debts were settled. It's unclear how long it will take for the dealer in question to repay his debt, but it's likely that he will be at the casino for some time.

If you find yourself in over your head with gambling debts, it's important to take action right away to avoid any further penalties. There are a number of solutions available for those who are struggling with gambling debts, including debt consolidation or even filing for bankruptcy.

No matter what steps you take, it's crucial to act quickly if you find yourself in over your head with gambling debts. The longer you wait, the more difficult it will become to resolve the situation.
