#  Illinois Casino Industry Poised for Major Expansion

Casino gambling is big business in Illinois, and it’s only getting bigger.

Following the legalization of casino gambling in 2009, the industry has experienced rapid growth. In just a few years, the number of casinos in Illinois has more than doubled, and annual gaming revenue has surpassed $1 billion.

Now, industry insiders are predicting even more expansion in the years ahead. In particular, they foresee a major boom in the Chicago area, where several new casinos are set to open in the next few years.

This expansion is good news for the state economy. Casino gambling is a major source of tax revenue, and it supports tens of thousands of jobs across Illinois.

So far, much of the growth in the industry has been concentrated in southern Illinois, where there is less competition from other states. But that is starting to change. In recent years, casino development has shifted northward, with new casinos popping up in Rockford, Aurora and Elgin.

The trend is likely to continue in the years ahead, as developers seek to capture a larger share of the Chicago market. The city already has five licensed casinos, and more are on the way.

In addition to the new casinos being built in Chicago itself, there are plans for a mega-resort just outside of town. If it goes ahead as planned, this development will include a casino with more than 2,000 slot machines and 100 table games.

It’s clear that casino gambling is here to stay in Illinois. With so much growth potential still left untapped, the future looks bright for both operators and players alike. So sit back and enjoy the ride – it’s going to be a wild one!

#  Illinois Casino Revenue Jumps 20 Percent

The state of Illinois’ casino revenue jumped by 20 percent in the month of July, compared to the same month last year.

This was announced by the Illinois Gaming Board on Tuesday. The Board also revealed that gross gaming revenue for July was $233 million. This is up from the $194 million generated in July 2017.

Of the total revenue, $195 million came from casinos located in Chicago and its suburbs. This marks an increase of 22 percent from the $162 million generated in July 2017. The remaining $38 million comes from casinos located outside of Chicago. This is a decrease of 5 percent from the $40 million generated in July 2017.

The largest contributor to the growth in casino revenue was Rivers Casino which generated $60.5 million in revenue, compared to $48.5 million last year. Crown Casino was next with revenues of $56.8 million, followed by Grand Victoria Casino with revenues of $54.8 million.

Revenues at Horseshoe Hammond Casino declined marginally from $27.9 million last year to $27.7 this year. However, there were gains reported at Ameristar East Chicago (from $15.8 million to $17 million) and Hollywood Casino Aurora (from $14.4 million to $16.7).

#  Illinois Gambling Revenue Tops $2 Billion

According to a report released this week by the Illinois Gaming Board, gambling revenue in the state topped $2 billion for the first time in 2018.

The $2.04 billion in total revenue was generated by casino gaming, riverboat casinos, horse racing, and slot machines at race tracks. This was an increase of 5.8% from 2017, when revenue totaled $1.92 billion.

Casino gaming accounted for the majority of the gambling revenue, generating $1.59 billion in 2018. This was an increase of 7.4% from 2017, when casino gaming revenue totaled $1.47 billion.

The growth in casino gaming revenue was driven primarily by an increase in the number of casinos in Illinois, as well as an increase in the amount of money wagered at those casinos. The number of casinos in Illinois increased from 10 in 2017 to 11 in 2018, and the amount wagered at those casinos increased from $11.8 billion in 2017 to $12.7 billion in 2018.

Riverboat casinos generated the second-largest amount of gambling revenue in 2018, totaling $318 million. This was a decrease of 3% from 2017, when riverboat casino revenue totaled $330 million.

Horse racing generated the third-largest amount of gambling revenue in 2018, totaling $296 million. This was a decrease of 3% from 2017, when horse racing revenue totaled $304 million.

Slot machines at race tracks generated the fourth-largest amount of gambling revenue in 2018, totaling $236 million. This was a decrease of 2% from 2017, when slot machines at race tracks generated $240 million.

#  Illinois Poised to Lead the Pack in Gambling Revenues

With the legalization of gambling on the horizon in Illinois, casinos and racetracks are preparing for a windfall in revenue. Lawmakers are estimating that gambling will bring in $1.2 billion in its first year, with that number increasing to $2.7 billion by 2023.

This isn’t the first time that Illinois has looked to gambling as a potential source of revenue; lawmakers have been trying to legalize casinos and racetracks for years. But this time it looks like things might actually happen, as both Democrats and Republicans support the measure.

One of the primary reasons for the increase in support is the addition of video gaming terminals (VGTs) to the proposal. These terminals would be placed in bars and other establishments across the state, and would allow people to gamble on games such as poker, blackjack, and slots.

Proponents of VGTs argue that they would provide a more safe and regulated way to gamble than at casinos or racetracks. And while there is some concern about increased addiction rates, studies have shown that VGTs are actually less addictive than traditional casino games.

The potential for increased revenue is also attracting interest from casino operators outside of Illinois. MGM Resorts has already announced plans to build a casino in Chicago if the measure passes, while Caesars Entertainment has expressed interest in expanding its operations in Springfield.

Regardless of whether or not these out-of-state companies get involved, it’s clear that Illinois is poised to lead the pack in gambling revenue. With billions of dollars on the line, lawmakers are unlikely to back down now.
