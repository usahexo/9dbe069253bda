#  Getting The Most Out Of Your Cover Business For Blackjack 18 - Azure 

Anyone can beat the casino with a little bit of planning and some inside knowledge. 

There are many different strategies for playing blackjack and casino games in general, but most require some level of skill or risk. With blackjack 18 – azure, there is a low-risk strategy that can help you get the most out of your cover business. 

This game is exclusive to the online casino, so you will need to open an account and make a deposit before you can begin playing. The good news is that this game offers some of the best odds in the casino, so your chances of winning are better than average.

To play blackjack 18 – azure, you will first need to familiarize yourself with the basic rules of the game. This version of blackjack is played with six decks of cards, and the object is to draw cards until you reach 21 or come as close as possible without going over. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and any king, queen or jack is worth 10 points.

You can place bets on either the player or dealer hand, and the bet must be at least equal to the minimum bet for that particular table. Once all bets have been placed, each player is dealt two cards face up and one card face down. The dealer then deals two cards face up to himself and one card face down. 

The player’s goal is to beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21. If the player’s hand total is higher than the dealer’s hand total, he wins even money on his bet (unless he has blackjack). If the player’s hand total is lower than the dealer’s hand total, he loses his bet. 

If both hands have the same value (a “push”), no money changes hands and players do not receive another card. In blackjack 18 – azure, players are allowed to hit as many times as they like as long as their hand total does not exceed 21. 

To win at this game, it is important to make smart decisions about when to hit and when to stand. You should also remember that if your hand total exceeds 21 after hitting (or if you bust), you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has in his hand. 

It is also important to keep an eye on the dealer’s upcard. If he has a low card (2 through 6), you should consider hitting even if your hand total is high because there is a good chance he will bust if he draws another card. Conversely, if the dealer has a high card (7 through Ace), you should stand unless your hand total is very high (17 or higher). 

The basic strategy for playing blackjack 18 – azure can be summarized as follows:



	Stand if your hand totals 7 or more; hit if your hand totals less than 7

	Stand if the dealer has a 2 through 6 showing; hit if he has any other card showing 	Double down on 10 and 11 only; never split tens or elevens

	Split 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s against any dealer card except an ace; never split 2s

	Hit on soft 17 (an Ace plus any other number)
