#  Titans Could Sport New Uniforms for Season Opener

Tennessee Titans owner Amy Adams Strunk recently hinted that the team might have a new set of uniforms for their upcoming season opener against the Miami Dolphins. This would be the first time in franchise history that the Titans have changed their uniforms.

“We are working on something,” Strunk said. “I think it will be great for our fans.”

The Titans current uniforms were unveiled in 2015 and are generally considered to be one of the NFL’s more plain and boring designs. It is not clear what kind of changes Strunk has in mind, but NFL teams have been trending towards more flashy and outlandish designs in recent years. The Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Rams, and Oakland Raiders all made major changes to their uniforms prior to the 2017 season.

Some possible changes that could be made include adding more color to the uniform, changing the jersey or helmet design, or adding additional elements such as stripes or logos. It is also possible that the team could go back to their original navy blue and white color scheme, which was replaced by a red, white, and silver design in 2015.

The Titans are coming off of a tough 9-7 season where they narrowly missed out on making the playoffs. The team will need to improve on both sides of the ball if they want to make a run at the Super Bowl this year. A new set of uniforms could help give the team a fresh start heading into the new season.

#  Titans Hope Sports Betting Will Bring in More Fans

The Tennessee Titans are a professional football team that plays in the NFL. The team is based in Nashville, Tennessee. The Titans were founded in 1960 and have played in the NFL since their inception. The Titans have had some success over the years, but they have never won a Super Bowl.

The Titans are hoping that legalized sports betting will help them draw in more fans. In particular, they are hoping that people who live in neighboring states will start to become fans of the team and attend games at Nissan Stadium.

Legalized sports betting is a hot topic right now, as more and more states are moving to adopt laws that allow it. Sports betting has long been illegal in most states, but that is starting to change. The Supreme Court recently struck down a law that made sports betting illegal, which has led to a flurry of activity at the state level as lawmakers rush to legalize it.

Tennessee is one of the states that is moving to legalize sports betting. The state legislature recently passed a bill that would allow casinos to offer sports betting, and Governor Bill Haslam has said he will sign it into law. This means that the Titans could soon see an influx of new fans from neighboring states who are interested in placing bets on games.

Some people oppose legalized sports betting, arguing that it will lead to addiction and other social problems. However, proponents of legalization argue that it is a relatively harmless way for people to engage in recreation gambling, and that it can bring in much-needed revenue to state governments.

Whether you support or oppose legalized sports betting, it seems clear that it is going to become increasingly prevalent across the United States. This could be good news for the Tennessee Titans, as they look to attract more fans to their games.

#  Should Tennessee Titans Legalize Sports Betting?

In a recent ESPN poll, 78 percent of NFL fans stated that they would be in favor of the Tennessee Titans legalizing sports betting. This is not surprising, as legalized sports betting could bring in an estimated $2.3 billion per year in revenue for the NFL. In this article, we will explore the benefits of legalizing sports betting and whether or not the Tennessee Titans should legalize it.

One of the main benefits of legalizing sports betting is that it would create jobs. The American Gaming Association estimates that legalized sports betting would create over 103,000 jobs. These jobs would include everything from casino workers to data analysts to marketing professionals. Tax revenue from legal sports betting would also be used to fund public education, infrastructure projects, and other important programs.

Legalizing sports betting would also generate significant revenue for states and the federal government. In Nevada, where sports betting has been legal for many years, over $4 billion was wagered on the Super Bowl in 2018. If Tennessee were to legalize sports betting, it is likely that a significant portion of this money would stay in the state. This money could be used to fund important programs like education and infrastructure projects.

There are some who argue that legalizing sports betting could lead to increased rates of problem gambling. However, there is evidence that this is not necessarily the case. A study by Oxford Economics found that while problem gambling rates could increase by 3 percent if sports betting were legalized nationwide, this would still leave the overall rate of problem gambling at just 2 percent. This is significantly lower than the rate of problem gambling in countries like Australia and Canada where sports betting is already legal.

Ultimately, whether or not the Tennessee Titans should legalize sports betting comes down to a few key factors. First, lawmakers must decide if they believe that legalizing sports betting would be beneficial for the state economy. They must also weigh any potential risks against the benefits. Finally, they must decide if they believe that Tennesseans are ready for legalized sports betting.

#  State Senator Bets on Titans to Win Super Bowl

In a show of confidence in the Tennessee Titans, state senator Dean Schneider put his money where his mouth is, betting on the team to win the Super Bowl this year.

Senator Schneider believes that the Titans have what it takes to take home the Lombardi Trophy this year, and he’s not alone – many experts are picking them to make a deep playoff run.

The Titans certainly have all of the pieces in place to make a championship run. Quarterback Marcus Mariota has been one of the most consistent players in the league over the past few years, and he has plenty of weapons at his disposal, including running back Derrick Henry, wide receivers Corey Davis and Rishard Matthews, and tight end Delanie Walker.

The defense is also stacked with talent, headlined by Pro Bowlers Jurrell Casey, Morgan Burnett, and Logan Ryan.

With everything on their side, the Titans are definitely poised for a big year. And if they can manage to win the Super Bowl this year, Senator Schneider will be one very happy man.

#  Oklahoma lawmakers to discuss legalizing sports betting

Oklahoma lawmakers are set to discuss the possibility of legalizing sports betting in the state during the upcoming legislative session.

State Rep. Adam Parkhomenko, D-Tulsa, said he plans to introduce a bill that would legalize and regulate sports betting in Oklahoma.

“It’s something we need to take a look at. I don’t see any harm in it,” Parkhomenko said.

Under Parkhomenko's proposed bill, sports betting could only take place at casinos and racetracks in the state. The legislation would also allow the Oklahoma Gaming Commission to regulate and tax sports betting.

While no other lawmakers have yet come out in support of the proposed bill, Parkhomenko says he is hopeful that there will be bipartisan support for the measure when it is introduced.

Legalizing sports betting could bring in much-needed revenue for Oklahoma, which is facing a budget shortfall of more than $900 million for the upcoming fiscal year. In addition, regulating and taxing sports betting could create new jobs in the state.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates and organized crime activity. However, many states that have legalized sports betting report that these concerns have not been realized.

With neighboring states like Arkansas and Texas already allowing sports betting, it is likely only a matter of time before Oklahoma follows suit.
