#  Yankees Win First Game of the Season in Thrilling Fashion

The Yankees started the 2018 campaign on a high note, defeating the Blue Jays 8-7 in 11 innings.

Gary Sanchez led off the bottom of the 11th with a solo home run to give the Yankees the victory. It was Sanchez's second home run of the game.

The Yankees got off to a slow start, falling behind 5-1 after four innings. The comeback began in the sixth inning, when Sanchez hit a two-run homer to cut Toronto's lead to 5-3.

In the seventh inning, Aaron Judge hit a grand slam to give the Yankees a 7-5 lead. The Blue Jays tied the game in the eighth inning, but New York prevailed in the end.

It was an encouraging start for the Yankees, who are looking to win their 28th World Series championship this season.

#  Sabathia Solid in Season Debut, Yankees Defeat Rays 3-2

CC Sabathia pitched six innings, allowing two runs on six hits and a walk while striking out four batters as the Yankees defeated the Rays 3-2.

It was an encouraging start to the season for Sabathia, who battled injuries last year and finished with a career-worst 5.28 ERA. He looked sharp in his first outing of the 2019 campaign, inducing nine swinging strikes and generating three groundball outs.

"I felt good," Sabathia said. "I was able to mix it up. I thought my offspeed stuff was pretty good."

Sabathia's fastball averaged 91.8 mph in this outing, up from 90.4 mph last season. That uptick in speed could be a sign that he is feeling healthy and getting back to his old form.

The Yankees got a big boost offensively from Gary Sanchez, who hit two home runs off of Rays starter Tyler Glasnow. Sanchez has now hit 11 home runs in his last 18 games against Tampa Bay.

"He's been really hot against us," Rays manager Kevin Cash said of Sanchez. "We know he's a threat."

Yankees manager Aaron Boone was happy with the way Sanchez slugged his way out of an early-season funk (.167 batting average entering Wednesday's game).

"It's good to see him get going," Boone said. "Hopefully that can be a spark for him."

#  Gardner, Gregorius Homer in Yankees Victory Over Orioles

It was a great night for the New York Yankees as they got back in the win column with an 8-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. The offense got going early with a three-run home run by Didi Gregorius in the second inning, and then added to their lead with a solo homer by Gardner in the third.

Baltimore got on the board in the fourth inning, but New York responded with two more runs in the bottom of that inning to make it 5-1. The Orioles made things interesting with four runs in the top of the seventh inning, but Gardner came through again with a two-RBI double in the bottom of that inning to seal the victory.

Despite some shaky pitching at times, it was a much-needed win for the Yankees as they try to make a playoff run down the stretch. And it was also a nice respite for Gardner, who has been struggling at the plate recently.

"It feels good," said Gardner of his big night at the plate. "I've been trying to stay positive and grind out at-bats."

Yankees manager Joe Girardi was happy to see his team get back on track after losing three games in a row over the weekend.

"We needed that," said Girardi. "I thought our offense did a really good job tonight."

Gardner and Gregorius both had three hits on the night, and rookie Tyler Austin also chipped in with an RBI double as the Yankees pounded out 13 hits overall. CC Sabathia got the win despite giving up four runs over six innings pitched.

The New York Yankees took on the Kansas City Royals on Sunday afternoon and came away with a 7-2 victory. Giancarlo Stanton was one of the stars of the game, as he hit two home runs.

Stanton got things started early for the Yankees with a solo home run in the fourth inning. He then added another home run in the sixth inning, this one a two-run shot that gave the Yankees a 5-2 lead.

It was Stanton's third two-homer game of the season. He now has 36 home runs on the year, tying him with Khris Davis for second most in the American League.

The Yankees offense also got contributions from Aaron Hicks and Didi Gregorius, who each had two hits on the day. Gleyber Torres drove in three runs with a single and a double.

Yankees starter CC Sabathia got the win, pitching six innings and allowing two runs on six hits. He now has 15 wins on the season. Aroldis Chapman got his 33rd save of the year with a scoreless ninth inning.

The Yankees will now head to Boston for a three-game series against the Red Sox starting on Monday night.

#  Tanaka brilliant in season opener, leads yankees over Red Sox

Masahiro Tanaka dazzled in his season debut Saturday, allowing just two hits while striking out nine in seven innings to lead the New York Yankees over the Boston Red Sox 3-0.

Gary Sanchez hit a two-run homer and Brian McCann added an RBI single for the Yankees, who rebounded from a tough opening loss to Toronto on Thursday. Tanaka (1-0) was pitching on three days' rest and looked fresh, retiring his first 12 batters before Alex Rodriguez reached on an infield single in the fifth.

Tanaka allowed just four baserunners in all and improved to 5-0 in six starts against Boston. Dellin Betances completed the five-hitter with two innings of scoreless relief.

Rick Porcello (0-1) gave up three runs - all on Sanchez's homer - and four hits in six innings for Boston. David Ortiz went 0 for 3 and is now 0 for 11 against Tanaka.
