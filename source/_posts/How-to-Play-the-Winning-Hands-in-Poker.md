#  How to Play the Winning Hands in Poker

Almost all poker players want to know how to play the winning hands. It's not just about playing the hands correctly, but also knowing when to play them and how much money to bet. In this article, we will discuss some of the most common winning hands in poker and offer some tips on playing them.

The first and most powerful hand in poker is a royal flush. A royal flush is made up of 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace of the same suit. This hand is so strong that it's usually worth betting all your chips in order to win the pot.

Another very strong hand is a straight flush, which is made up of five cards in sequence, all of the same suit. This hand can beat any other hand except for a royal flush. If you are fortunate enough to get two straights flush, the higher ranking one wins.

A four of a kind is another very strong hand and it's made up of four cards of the same rank. This hand can beat any other hand except for a straight flush or a royal flush. If you are lucky enough to get two fours of a kind, the rank of the fours decides who wins.

A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank and it beats any two pairs hand. If you are lucky enough to get two full houses, the rank of the triplets decides who wins.

A pair is any two cards of the same rank and it beats any single card hand. If you are unlucky enough to get two pairs, then the rank of the highest pair decides who wins.

  So now that we know what some of the winning hands are, let's take a look at some tips on how to play them: 

1) When playing a royal flush or straight flush, always bet everything you have! There is no point in trying to hold back in these situations as you only have a 1 in 6 chance of getting these hands anyway. 
2) When playing fours of a kind or full houses, always bet bigger than your opponents if you think they may have something better than you do. The reason for this is that these hands usually have high payouts if you win. 
3) When playing pairs, remember that your chances of winning are very high indeed! Unless you think your opponent has something better than your pair, always bet confidently against them without risking too much money.

#  Learn When to Play Which Hand in PokerStars

In poker, you will often be confronted with the decision of which hand to play. This decision is not always easy, and it can be made more difficult by the fact that there are many different factors to take into account.

The most important factor to consider when deciding which hand to play is your position at the table. As a general rule, you want to play hands that have good potential when you are in early position, and only play hands with good potential when you are in late position.

When you are in early position, you want to play hands that have a high chance of winning. This means playing hands like A-Q, K-Q, A-J, and so on. These hands have high potential because they can make strong pairs or straights.

When you are in late position, you can afford to be a bit more selective with your hands. You can afford to play hands like A-10 or even K-10 because you will have more information about what the other players at the table are holding. You also have the advantage of being able to see the turn and river cards before making your decision, which gives you a better idea of what the best possible hand is.

Another factor to consider when deciding which hand to play is your chip stack size. If you are short stacked, then you will want to focus on playing hands that have a high chance of winning on the flop. This means playing hands like A-K or Q-J, which have a good chance of making a strong pair or straight.

If you are sitting with a large chip stack, then you can afford to be a little more aggressive in your play. You can start by playing hands like A-10 or J-10, which have some potential for making a strong two pair or full house. Remember that if you do hit a strong hand, it is important to bet aggressively in order to scare off any opponents who may still be hoping to beat you.

#  Become a True Master of Hand Rankings in PokerStars

Do you want to take your Texas Hold’em skills to the next level? If so, learning the hand rankings is a must. Understanding which hands are stronger than others will help you make better decisions at the table and give you a better chance of winning.

In poker, there are 10 possible two-card combinations, or “hands”. The strongest hand is called a royal flush and consists of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit. Following this is the straight flush, which is five cards in consecutive rank of the same suit. After that is four of a kind, then a full house, then a three of a kind, and finally two pair. The weakest hand is known as high card and consists of any five unpaired cards.

If you are playing against one other player and both have no pairs, then the highest ranking card wins. For example, if one player has an Ace of Spades and the other has an Ace of Hearts, then the Ace of Spades would win since it is higher ranking than an Ace of Hearts. If both players have pairs however, then the highest ranking pair beats the lower ranking pair. So if one player has two Queens and the other has two Jacks, then the player with two Queens would win. If both players have identical pairs however (two Aces for example), then the pot would be split between them.

If you are playing against multiple opponents however, things get a bit more complicated. In this case, the hands are rank from strongest to weakest as follows: royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair and high card. The player with the highest ranking hand would win the pot. If there is a tie for the highest hand however (two royal flushes for example), then the pot would be split between them.
