#  Is there a limit to how much money can be wagered at Moroccan casinos?

Casinos in Morocco are currently legal and there is no limit to how much money can be wagered. The industry is booming, with new casinos opening all the time. This may change in the future, as the government is rumored to be considering placing a cap on how much money can be gambled.

There are a few different reasons why the government may want to do this. Firstly, it could be worried about how much money casinos are making. Casinos are taxed at a high rate, so the government could be looking to bring in more revenue. Secondly, the government may be concerned about the amount of gambling addiction in Morocco. There have been cases of people losing all their money in casinos and then being unable to afford to live.

If the government does decide to place a cap on how much money can be wagered, it is likely that it will be a low amount. This would still bring in extra revenue for the government, while also protecting people from getting into too much debt.
