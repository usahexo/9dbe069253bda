#  Computers are better than humans at sports betting, study finds 

## Computers are better than humans when it comes to sports betting, a new study has found.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester in the United States, looked at how well computer algorithms could predict the outcomes of professional football games.

It found that while human bettors may be better at making judgments based on their own knowledge and intuition, computer algorithms are better at considering all of the relevant data in order to make accurate predictions.

“Our analysis shows that bookmakers’ odds are significantly more accurate than any human forecast, and that the use of computers can improve these estimates even further,” said Dr. Yaniv Altshuler, who led the study.

The findings have important implications for people who bet on sports matches. Not only do computer algorithms outperform human bettors when it comes to predicting outcomes, but they can also help identify value bets – i.e bets where the odds offered by bookmakers are not reflective of the true chances of a particular outcome occurring.

This means that by using computer algorithms to guide their betting choices, punters can make more informed decisions and maximise their profits.

#  How do computers do sports betting? 

People have been betting on sports for centuries, but the advent of computers has made it possible to do so in new and more sophisticated ways. So how do they do it?

Broadly speaking, computer-based sports betting methods can be divided into two categories: those that use statistics to make predictions and those that use artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate real-life sporting scenarios.

Statistical methods use historical data to identify patterns in the outcomes of various sporting contests. This data is then used to make informed predictions about future match outcomes. One popular statistical method is known as “odds-matching”, which involves comparing the odds given by different bookmakers for particular matches in order to identify any discrepancies. This information can be used to place better bets by identifying where there is value in the market.

Artificial intelligence approaches attempt to model the behaviour of real-life sporting teams and players in order to make predictions about the outcome of future games. One advantage of using AI is that it can take into account a much wider range of factors than statistical methods, such as weather conditions, player injuries, and morale. This can lead to more accurate predictions, although it can also be more complicated and time-consuming to develop these models.

Whichever approach is used, computerised sports betting offers several advantages over traditional betting methods. First, it allows you to bet on a wider range of markets, including matches that are not covered by traditional bookmakers. Second, it provides access to more detailed information about each game and the teams involved, which can help you make more informed decisions about your bets. Finally, it allows you to place bets quickly and easily without having to go through a third party such as a bookmaker.

#  How computer algorithms can help you make money betting on sports 

To make money betting on sports, you need to have an edge. You need to find information that the general public doesn’t know. One way to do this is by using computer algorithms.

Computer algorithms can help you identify trends and patterns in data that would be difficult to spot manually. For example, a computer algorithm might be able to identify when a team is likely to win or lose based on their past performance.

You can also use computer algorithms to analyse statistical data for individual players. This information can be used to help you determine the odds of a player scoring a goal, for example.

It’s important to note that computer algorithms are not 100% reliable. However, they can provide you with a valuable insight into how a game might play out. If used correctly, they can give you an edge over the competition and help you make money betting on sports.

#  The future of computerized sports betting: Sky88's Nicolas Guibert weighs in 

The sports betting industry is ripe for technological innovation. Throughout history, people have wagered on the outcomes of sporting events, and this tradition continues today. In many cases, sports betting takes place in person, with people placing bets in person or over the phone. However, there is also a growing online sports betting market. 

A number of technological advancements have made their way into the sports betting industry in recent years. The advent of mobile devices has allowed people to bet on sporting events from anywhere in the world. In addition, sophisticated algorithms are now being used to predict the outcomes of sporting events, allowing bettors to make more informed decisions. 

Despite these advancements, much of the sports betting industry remains tied to traditional methods. For example, Sky88 is a Singapore-based company that offers a computerized platform for placing sports bets. However, their service is limited to customers living in Singapore. This leaves a large portion of the world's population unable to use their service. 

This is where blockchain technology comes in. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure and transparent transactions without the need for a third party. This makes it an ideal technology for online sports betting, as it eliminates the need for middlemen such as bookmakers and casinos. 

There are a number of startups that are leveraging blockchain technology to create platforms for online sports betting. One such startup is Sportcoop, which plans to launch its platform in 2019. Sportcoop will use blockchain technology to create a decentralized network for online sports betting. This will allow users from around the world to participate in online sports betting without having to worry about censorship or fraud. 

Another startup that is leveraging blockchain technology for online sports betting is Betrium. Betrium plans to offer a wide range of features such as live betting, 24/7 customer support, and instant withdrawals. They also plan to offer lower commissions than traditional bookmakers, making it easier for bettors to make profits. 

It is clear that blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the online sports betting industry. By eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries, blockchain can create a more transparent and fair environment for customers worldwide. It remains to be seen which of these startups will be successful in bringing blockchain-based sports betting to the mainstream, but it is clear that this is an industry with plenty of potential growth ahead

#  Sky88's Nicolas Guibert discusses the role of computers in sports betting

The role of computers in sports betting is gaining in importance as the industry progresses. This was highlighted by Sky88's Nicolas Guibert, who is an expert in the field.

" Computers are used extensively for pricing (setting odds), trading, and marketing," said Guibert. "They have become essential to understanding where the market is and where it is going."

This was reflected in the findings of a study that was commissioned by Sky88 and conducted by the University of Applied Sciences in Düsseldorf. The study found that nearly three-quarters of all Bundesliga bets were placed through computers.

This reflects the growing importance of computerised betting systems, which are becoming more sophisticated all the time. They can analyse data faster and more accurately than any human could, meaning they are ideally placed to help punters make informed decisions about their bets.
