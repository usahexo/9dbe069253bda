#  Duty Roulette Level 60 - What Dungeons are Still Missing?

There are plenty of new Duty Roulette dungeons that have been released for level 60 players, but there are also a few older dungeons that are still missing from the list. It can be tough to know which dungeons are still missing from the Roulette, so we’ve put together this handy guide to help you out!

First up is The Binding Coil of Bahamut – Phase 3. This dungeon is a must-do for any endgame player, and it’s disappointing that it’s not yet available in the Duty Roulette. If you’re looking for a challenging dungeon with some great rewards, then look no further than The Binding Coil of Bahamut!

Another dungeon that’s still missing from the Duty Roulette is The Stone Vigil. This dungeon was made available in patch 2.4, and it provides players with a great challenge and some excellent rewards. If you’re looking for something new to do in the game, then The Stone Vigil is definitely worth checking out!

Finally, we have The Second Coil of Bahamut – Turn 4. This is another challenging dungeon that provides players with some excellent rewards. If you’re looking for a new challenge in the game, then make sure to check out The Second Coil of Bahamut – Turn 4!

#  A Look at the Dungeons Missing from Duty Roulette Level 60

With the release of patch 3.2, Square Enix introduced a new dungeon - The Lost City of Amdapor. Players could queue for this dungeon by selecting it from the Duty Roulette: Level 60 selection.

However, there are several other dungeons that are missing from the Duty Roulette: Level 60 selection. These dungeons include The Binding Coil of Bahamut, The Second Coil of Bahamut, Alexander - The Creator, and Savage - The Lord of Confusion.

Some players believe that these dungeons should be added to the Duty Roulette: Level 60 selection in order to provide more content for players at level 60. Others believe that these dungeons are too difficult and should not be added to the selection.

What do you think? Should these dungeons be added to the Duty Roulette: Level 60 selection?

#  Dungeons Still Missing from Duty Roulette Level 60 Edition

Since the release of patch 2.4, many players have taken to the new Duty Roulette: Level 60 dungeons in hopes of increasing their chances at obtaining valuable rewards. What they may not realize, however, is that two of the four level 60 roulette dungeons are currently unavailable: The Binding Coil of Bahamut and The Second Coil of Bahamut.

While some would say that this omission is simply a bug, there has yet to be any confirmation from Square Enix on the matter. In the meantime, players continue to search for clues and possibilities as to why these dungeons are missing.

One theory is that Square Enix is deliberately withholding these dungeons in order to create more hype for when they finally become available again. Given that The Binding Coil of Bahamut is widely considered to be one of the most difficult dungeon instances in the game, it’s possible that Square is saving it for a later date as an incentive for players to reach level 60.

Another possibility is that Square Enix has not released these dungeons because they are still in the process of testing and debugging them. This would make sense given how buggy some of the other new content has been since 2.4 launched. It’s possible that they don’t want players to experience these issues in such a challenging dungeon instance.

Whatever the reason may be, it’s clear that many players are eagerly waiting for The Binding Coil of Bahamut and The Second Coil of Bahamut to become available in Duty Roulette: Level 60. In the meantime, we can only speculate as to what might be causing their delay.
