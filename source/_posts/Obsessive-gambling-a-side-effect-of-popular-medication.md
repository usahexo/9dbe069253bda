#  Obsessive gambling a side effect of popular medication

Doctors are issuing a warning about the potential for obsessive gambling behavior as a side effect of a common medication. The drug in question is prescribed to treat Parkinson‚Äôs disease, restless leg syndrome, and other conditions.

The medication, Mirapex, has been linked to compulsive gambling in a number of cases. In some instances, people have lost large sums of money while gambling, even going into debt in order to continue their betting habits.

People who are taking Mirapex or similar drugs should be aware of the risk of developing an addiction to gambling. If you notice any signs that you may be addicted to gambling, it is important to speak with your doctor right away.

There are a number of ways to treat obsessive gambling behavior. Some people may need to stop taking the medication that is causing the problem. Others may benefit from therapy or treatment for addiction.

#  Patients warned about potential for obsessive gambling while on medication

* Patients have been warned about the potential for obsessive gambling behaviour while taking certain medications.

* The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued the warning after a number of cases were reported.

* The agency said that patients who are taking medication for conditions such as Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome and mood disorders may be at risk.

* Some of the medications known to cause gambling problems include dopamine agonists, which are used to treat Parkinson's disease, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are used to treat depression and anxiety disorders.

* The MHRA is advising patients who are taking these medications to be aware of the potential risks and to consult their doctor if they experience any changes in their gambling behaviour.

Parkinson‚Äôs Disease 

I was reading an article this morning on people with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (PD) and how they were ‚Äúwarned‚Äù of obsessive compulsive behavior or things like uncontrolled gambling while on different medications such as dopaminergic drugs {drugs that replenish dopamine levels in the brain}. This really made me think about my Uncle Joe. I remember when I was younger visiting him on Sunday mornings before church and he would be sitting at the kitchen table in his robe and slippers, completely absorbed in playing solitaire on the computer. I never really understood why until years later when he was finally diagnosed with PD. Looking back now, I can see some of the signs like when he would get really excited playing games or watching sports on TV, but at the time I just thought it was normal excitement. Like the saying goes, hindsight is 20/20. 
After reading this article, it made me kinda sad because I know there are probably other people out there who struggle with this kind of thing that we may not even know about due to lack of public knowledge or just not thinking about it. That is why I feel it is important for me to share my Uncle Joe‚Äôs story here in hopes that someone else might read it who may be struggling with something similar and realizes that they are not alone. 
My Aunt Jean always tells this story about how one time she went into Joe‚Äôs room where he had all his casino stuff set up on one side of the bed table and his Bible on the other side. She said she asked him what in the world was going on and how could he have both things sitting there right next to each other? And his response was ‚ÄúOh, well I just like to keep them close by so I can make a quick getaway if things start going bad!‚Äù Haha! Even though it is funny now, you can tell there was definitely some underlying sadness there too. 
It wasn‚Äôt until after Joe‚Äôs death that my Aunt learned even more about his hidden battle with PD-related Obsessive Compulsive Behavior (OCB). Apparently a big part of this involved him trying to control everything around him including thoughts, impulses, etc., as a way of coping/trying to maintain some sense of normalcy or control during a time when so much was seemingly out of his hands. As you can imagine, living with PD can be extremely difficult emotionally and mentally for both patients and caregivers alike, so ANYTHING that provides some relief or distraction can become addicting in a sense‚Ä¶and that includes gambling for many people. 
I don‚Äôt want anyone to think that PD-OCB is limited to those who take dopaminergic drugs either because man...that would just suck! According to studies done by The National Center for Responsible Gaming {an organization focused on helping problem gamblers}, anywhere from 30-60% of all people who have PD also experience some type of gambling issue {compared to only 2-5% of the general population}. It makes you wonder how many more cases like Uncle Joe‚Äôs might go undiagnosed or unreported because people feel ashamed or embarrassed about it‚Ä¶or they simply don‚Äôt know how to bring it up to their doctor out of fear of being judged or labeled somehow? 
At any rate, I just wanted to share my Uncle Joe‚Äôs story here in case it might help someone else out there who is struggling with something similar but doesn't know where to turn for help. As always, feel free to reach out if you want to talk more about any of this stuff üôÇ

#  Gambling addiction may be a side effect of your medication

If you are taking medication and find that you are frequently gambling, it may be a side effect of your prescription drug. You should talk to your doctor about this potential side effect and see if there is an alternative medication available that does not have this side effect.

Gambling can be addictive, and for some people, it can be hard to stop. If you are taking medication and find that you are gambling more than usual, it may be a sign that the medication is causing this problem.

It is important to talk to your doctor about this potential side effect. He or she may be able to prescribe a different medication that does not have this side effect. Additionally, your doctor can help you develop a plan to address your gambling addiction.

If you are struggling with a gambling addiction, seek help. There are many resources available to help you get started on the road to recovery.

#  Are you at risk for developing a gambling addiction while on medication?

There is a lot of concern about the possibility of developing a gambling addiction while on medication, but there is not a lot of information about it. The reason for this is that there have not been a lot of studies done on the subject.

There are a few things that you need to know about the risk of developing a gambling addiction while on medication:

*The likelihood of developing a gambling addiction while on medication depends on the specific medication and the individual.

*Certain medications, such as those used to treat ADHD, have been linked with an increased risk of developing a gambling addiction.

*If you are taking medication and you feel like you are losing control over your gambling habit, it is important to speak to your doctor immediately.

#  Obsessive gambling could be a sign that your medication is not working correctly

Obsessive gambling could be a sign that your medication is not working correctly. The impulsivity and compulsiveness associated with this type of behaviour could be a sign that your medication is not suppressing the symptoms sufficiently. If you are concerned that your medication is not working correctly, speak to your doctor. They may be able to adjust your prescription or recommend another treatment.
