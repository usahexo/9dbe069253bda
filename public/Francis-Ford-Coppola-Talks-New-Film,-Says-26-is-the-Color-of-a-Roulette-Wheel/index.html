The famed director, who is celebrating his 79th birthday today, detailed how he became involved in the production and also shared some personal thoughts on gambling.</p>
<p>“I read the script and I liked it,” said Coppola. “It was something different for me.”</p>
<p>Written by Academy Award-nominated screenwriter William Monahan (“The Departed”), “The Gambler” is a remake of the 1974 James Caan film of the same name. Mark Wahlberg stars as Jim Bennet, a literature professor with a gambling addiction that threatens to destroy his life. John Goodman and Brie Larson also star in the film, which is set to hit theaters on December 19th.</p>
<p>Coppola spoke at length about his love for cinema and how he continues to find inspiration in his work. He also shared some amusing stories about his past experiences with Hollywood players such as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Asked if he had any advice for aspiring filmmakers, Coppola offered the following:</p>
<p>“Study hard and learn all you can,” said Coppola. “Be passionate about cinema, because that’s all that really matters in the end.”</p>
<p>In addition to his work on “The Gambler”, Coppola is also prepping a new documentary on wine making called “Inside Napa”. The film will explore how wine has impacted both American culture and California’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="26-is-the-Color-of-a-Roulette-Wheel-Francis-Ford-Coppola’s-New-Film-Explained"><a href="#26-is-the-Color-of-a-Roulette-Wheel-Francis-Ford-Coppola’s-New-Film-Explained" class="headerlink" title="26 is the Color of a Roulette Wheel: Francis Ford Coppola’s New Film Explained"></a>26 is the Color of a Roulette Wheel: Francis Ford Coppola’s New Film Explained</h1><p>After a four year absence from filmmaking, Francis Ford Coppola has returned with the release of “26”, a movie set in the 1970s about the world of gambling. The film has been met with mixed reviews, but what is it that Coppola is trying to say with “26”?</p>
<p>The title of “26” is a reference to the 26 black numbers on a roulette wheel. This is not some random choice by Coppola, as gambling has been a recurring theme in his films throughout his career. In “The Godfather”, Vito Corleone is a powerful figure in the world of gambling, and “The Outsiders” features a high school football team that makes its money through illegal bets.</p>
<p>With “26”, Coppola seems to be exploring the idea of luck and chance. The film follows several different characters who are all connected to the world of gambling in some way. There’s Cameron (Johnathon Schaech), a young man who is trying to make his fortune at the casino; Vincent (Bruce Willis), an aging mobster who is struggling to stay afloat; and Louise (Sharon Stone), Vincent’s ex-wife and the owner of a casino. These characters are all at different points in their lives, and they are all looking for something that they can’t find elsewhere.</p>
<p>For Cameron, gambling is a way to escape from his mundane life; for Vincent, it’s an addiction that he can’t break free from; and for Louise, it’s a way to make money after her casino has gone bankrupt. These characters are all searching for something that they can’t find in the real world, and they turn to gambling as a way to fill that void.</p>
<p>As with most of Coppola’s films, “26” is not just about plot or character development; it’s also about exploring human emotions. Gambling can be seen as a metaphor for life itself: it’s full of surprises, and you never know what’s going to happen next. Coppola seems to be saying that life is full of risks, and sometimes you have to take chances in order to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>This isn’t a new idea, of course; Frank Sinatra said something very similar in his song “Luck Be A Lady”. But with “26”, Coppola brings his unique perspective to the subject matter, creating a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.</p>
<h1 id="Francis-Ford-Coppola’s-New-Film-Features-26-as-the-Color-of-a-Roulette-Wheel"><a href="#Francis-Ford-Coppola’s-New-Film-Features-26-as-the-Color-of-a-Roulette-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="Francis Ford Coppola’s New Film Features 26 as the Color of a Roulette Wheel"></a>Francis Ford Coppola’s New Film Features 26 as the Color of a Roulette Wheel</h1><p>Francis Ford Coppola’s upcoming film, “Roulette,” is set to feature the number 26 as the color of a roulette wheel. The announcement was made earlier this week by the famed director himself in a post on his personal blog.</p>
<p>“I’ve been wanting to make a film about roulette for a long time,” Coppola wrote in his post. “The game has always fascinated me, with its mix of chance and strategy.”</p>
<p>The film will tell the story of two estranged brothers who are brought back together by their love of roulette. The older brother, played by Al Pacino, is a veteran gambler who has spent his life chasing the elusive big win. The younger brother, played by James Franco, is an up-and-coming mathematician who has developed a new system for beating the casino.</p>
<p>The two brothers team up to take on the casinos in a series of high-stakes games. Along the way they are pursued by loan sharks and other criminals who want to steal their hard-won profits.</p>
<p>“Roulette” has already begun filming and is scheduled for release in late 2017.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Francis-Ford-Coppola’s-New-Film-Really-About-26-and-a-Roulette-Wheel"><a href="#Is-Francis-Ford-Coppola’s-New-Film-Really-About-26-and-a-Roulette-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="Is Francis Ford Coppola’s New Film Really About 26 and a Roulette Wheel?"></a>Is Francis Ford Coppola’s New Film Really About 26 and a Roulette Wheel?</h1><p>It’s been a busy year for famed film director Francis Ford Coppola, with his latest movie “Twixt” set to premiere at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival this May. The film, described as a “thriller/fantasy/romance”, is about a young writer named Hall Baltimore (played by Val Kilmer) who, while in town to promote his new book, becomes haunted by the ghost of a dead girl.</p>
<p>But what most people don’t know is that Coppola’s film may actually be based on a true story - specifically, the story of 26-year-old investment banker David Ruffley and his ill-fated trip to Atlantic City. In May of 2009, Ruffley placed a $100 bet on black at the roulette table and ended up winning $26,000. Unfortunately, he was then banned from the casino for life.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Ruffley’s story bears a striking resemblance to that of Hall Baltimore in “Twixt”. Like Baltimore, Ruffley was a young writer visiting town to promote his work; like Baltimore, Ruffley became haunted by the ghost of a dead girl; and like Baltimore, Ruffley lost all his money gambling at the blackjack table.</p>
<p>So is Coppola’s new film really about 26 and a roulette wheel? It sure looks that way.</p>

<p>“The American Film Institute voted ‘The Godfather’ the second-greatest American movie of all time, after ‘ Citizen Kane,’ “ Mr. Coppola said. “I am confident that this new film will achieve the same level of success.”</p>
<p>In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the director said he’s been working on the screenplay for a year and that the film will be set in the present day.</p>
<p>He also said that his son Roman would direct some of the movie and that Al Pacino and Diane Keaton would reprise their roles from the first three films.’ -NY Times</p>
<p>After months of speculation, Paramount Pictures confirms that Academy Award-winning director Francis Ford Coppola is making The Godfather: Part IV. In what promises to be an epic conclusion to one of cinema’s most beloved sagas, the long-awaited fourth chapter will be set against the backdrop of contemporary America.<br>All eyes are on Coppola to see how he’ll top The Godfather: Part III, widely considered to be a disappointment in comparison to its predecessors. But with a cast including Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of Michael Corleone and Al Pacino—reprising his role as Don Vito Corleone—The Godfather: Part IV is already shaping up to be one of the most highly anticipated films of 2020.<br>What can we expect from this new installment? Here’s what we know so far about The Godfather: Part IV.</p>
<p>First and foremost, The Godfather: Part IV will explore Michael Corleone’s journey from young man to elder statesman. In an interview with Deadline, Coppola hinted that we may see a different side to Michael this time around: “In this movie, I’m going back ad doing things I haven’t done in my other movies,” he said. “I’m looking at Michael over a long period of time, where he’s older now and has children.”<br>It remains to be seen whether or not The Godfather: Part IV will address some of the loose ends left dangling by its predecessor, but given Coppola’s propensity for exploration and development, it seems likely that we’ll get some answers concerning Michael Corleone’s future.<br>One thing is for sure: Al Pacino is eager to reprise his role as one of cinema’s most iconic villains. “I am very excited about this part,” he told Deadline . “It feels like another home run.”<br>Filming is scheduled to begin in early 2019, so mark your calendars—The Godfather: Part IV is coming soon!</p>
